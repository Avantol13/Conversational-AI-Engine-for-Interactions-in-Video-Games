Conversational AI Engine for Video Games
========================================================

System for dynamic conversations based on characters' personality and emotions.

The goal of this project is to create a system for video games that better simulates real people and real conversations. It is highly focused on maintaining ease of implementation for developers and providing the capability and expandability for large, virtual environments.

That being said, it is in it's very early phases and my hopes are that YOU will see what I'm trying to do and contribute in any way you can! I am by no means a fantastic programmer, as I'm still learning (currently in college), but programming, problem solving, creativity, and innovation have always been a passion of mine.

Thanks for checking this out and happy coding!

Many thanks!
