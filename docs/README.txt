Explanation of files:

  1. javadoc contains all the, well, javadoc stuff
  
    -I believe you can just double-click on the index.html and navigate around after that. 
    
    -This will not be updated every time I change source files so it will probably be outdated.
     (Should you want a recent version, just let me know, I'll reupload)

  2. AI.gsheet is a Google Sheet (you can grab the URL from the file and throw it into your browser)
  
    -This contains the data I recieved from various people to determine how I should calculate the emotional modifiers
     based on each personality type. e.g. A high level of Extraversion will cause a positive multiplier on statements
     that attempt to alter Joy. 
    
    -You'll have to request to edit/view. I believe I have it locked at the moment. Just send a request.
    
  3. AI_Architect.eap is an Enterprise Architect file that contains UML diagrams for all my source files
  
    -I will most likely not update this every time I change the source files, so it will probably be outdated.
    
    -The intention is to have this as some documentation of the final product (whenever that will be).
    
  4. Official Documentation.rtf is a file generated from Enterprise Architect that probably has no value whatsoever
  
    -Thought I'd include it here just cause. Maybe I'll take the time when this is done to make the documentation
     a bit nicer.
