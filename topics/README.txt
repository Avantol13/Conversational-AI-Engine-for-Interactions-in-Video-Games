This folder contains all of the XML files that represent the available topics (and statements).
The topics in here are experimental in nature and aren't very representative of what a final
implementation of the system will look like. At the moment, I have no tool to create these
topics (though it's part of the plan) so these have to be created by hand and I'm lazy. 
Thus, the current selection of topics and statements are terrible. Should you like to add
topics and statements that make sense, please do.
